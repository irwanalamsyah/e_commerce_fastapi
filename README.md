# FastAPI x Tortoise ORM 


## FastAPI

## Tortoise ORM

Tortoise ORM is an easy-to-use ``asyncio`` ORM *(Object Relational Mapper)* inspired by Django.

Tortoise ORM was built with relations in mind and admiration for the excellent and popular Django ORM.
It's engraved in its design that you are working not with just tables, you work with relational data.
